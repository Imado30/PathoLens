# Medical Imaging Diagnostic Aid Platform

A full-stack web application that supports medical diagnoses through AI-powered image analysis. The platform enables doctors to view MRI images, visualize AI predictions, and enhance their diagnoses by incorporating external feedback (AI models) using annotations and interactive tools. The application provides a user-friendly interface to assist doctors in the precise and efficient diagnosis of complex medical pathologies.
